1. Convert all <div> tags to semantic html tags.
2. Think carefully about where to place the

			<p>If you've got lots of money and you're a bit daft, NFTs are a 
				great way to pay for something that doesn't have any intrinsic 
				value or even exist. Tech fashionistas are jumping on the NFT 
				bandwagon and spending eye-watering sums of money on crypto images. 
				Our advice: spend the weekend <a class="aCr" target="_blank" href="">crafting an NFT</a> and by 
				this time next week, you'll be a millionaire.</p>

            <p>Is $33k for sneakers too basic for you? No problem! This CryptoPunk 
				(left) is a steal at $6.6 million! Which makes Bag #748 (right) a 
				total bargain at $1.4 million. And by the way, that's not a VS 
				Code screenshot we included by mistake. The eight lines of white text 
				on a black background is the actual NFT we're selling.</p>
